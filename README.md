HydroBlock is a Decentralized App for buying and selling water in blockchain. This app was built for Pune Smart City hackathon.
# Problem Statement

  - Water is critical for socio-economic development and healthy ecosystems. Most of the cities are suffering from ground water shortage. Markdown
  - India like many others is also suffering from worst water crisis and around 600 million people face a severe water shortage.


  - Approximately 200,000 people die every year due to inadequate access to clean water and it’s “only going to get worse” as 21 cities are likely to run out of groundwater by 2020.
  - “By 2030, the country’s water demand is projected to be twice the available supply,” the Niti Aayog report reads. “[This will cause] severe water scarcity for hundreds of millions of people.”

# Solution

- We envision to build a Decentralized Application for peer to peer trading platform for water using blockchain. 
- What is Blockchain? -- It  is a form of open, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) which is useful to record the transfer of assets.
- Each person is allotted a limited quantity of water per day. We plan to create a Supply-Demand chain of water and allow people with excess water to sell to those in need at a fair price.
- Rain Water Harvesting:  People will be encouraged to practise rain water harvesting in order to gain further incentives , which would eventually lead to rise in Ground Water Table and Equitable Distribution of Water

## Uses of Blockchain in our App 

- No Middleman
- Fair Trade - Prices cannot be manipulated by any individual 
- Automation of payment and water supply powered by blockchain
- Availability and easy access of water to everyone
Transparency
- Immutability 
- Trustless transactions
